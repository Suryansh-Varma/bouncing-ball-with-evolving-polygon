## Polygon Bounce Simulation

A fun, interactive web-based simulation where a ball bounces inside a growing regular polygon, with comedic "escape" events!

## Features âœ¨

- **Growing Polygon**: Starts as a pentagon (4 sides) and gains a new side each time the ball hits any edge
- **Polygon Names**: Displays correct names (Pentagon, Hexagon, etc.) in the center
- **Random Escapes**: The ball might randomly escape the polygon with funny messages
- **Voice Announcements**: Speaks the polygon name when sides increase and funny messages when the ball escapes
- **Restart Button**: Reset the simulation at any time
- **Playful Design**: Comic Sans font and humorous tone throughout

## How to Use ðŸš€

1. Simply open `page.html` in any modern web browser
2. Watch the ball bounce and the polygon grow!
3. When the ball escapes (it will eventually), you'll see a funny message
4. Click "Restart Simulation" to start over

## Technical Details 

- Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no dependencies)
- Uses Canvas API for rendering
- Web Speech API for voice synthesis
- RequestAnimationFrame for smooth animation

## Fun Easter Eggs 

- The ball might say it's "on strike" or "went to get milk" when it escapes
- Different funny messages appear randomly
- Voice announcements get more excited when the ball escapes

## Requirements 

- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
- For voice synthesis: Browser must support Web Speech API
